# Importing events from third\-party calendar providers<a name="change-calendar-import"></a>

Use the following procedure to import an iCalendar \(`.ics`\) file from a supported third\-party calendar application\. The events contained in the file are incorporated into the rules for your open or closed calendar\. You can import a file into a new calendar you are creating with Change Calendar \(a capability of AWS Systems Manager\) or into an existing calendar\.

After you import the `.ics` file, you can remove individual events from it using the Change Calendar interface\. For information, see [Deleting a Change Calendar event](change-calendar-delete-event.md)\. You can also delete all events from the source calendar by deleting the `.ics` file\. For information, see [Deleting all events imported from a third\-party calendar](change-calendar-delete-ics.md)\.
