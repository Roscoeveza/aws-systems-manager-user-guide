# Monitoring your change request events<a name="monitoring-change-request-events"></a>

After turning on integration with AWS CloudTrail Lake and creating an event data store, you can view auditable details about the change requests that are run in your account or organization\. This includes details such as the following:
+ The identity of the user that initiated the change request
+ The AWS Regions where the changes were made
+ The source IP address for the request
+ The AWS access key used for the request
+ The API actions run for the change request
+ The request parameters included for those actions
+ The resources updated during the process

The following are samples of event details you can view for a change request after creating the event data store in AWS CloudTrail Lake\.

#### [ Details ]

The following image shows the high\-level information about a change request available on the **Details** tab\. These details include information such as the time the change request operation began, the ID of the user that initiated the change request, the impacted AWS Region, and the event ID and request ID associated with the request\.

#### [ Event record ]

The following image shows the structure of the JSON content provided by CloudTrail Lake for a change request event\. This data is provided on the **Event record** tab in a change request\.

**Important**  
If you're using Change Manager for an organization, you can complete the following procedure while signed in to either the management account or the delegated administrator account for Change Manager\.  
However, to use the delegated administrator account to complete these steps, the same delegated administrator account must be specified for both CloudTrail and Change Manager\.  
When you sign in to the management account for Change Manager, you can add or change the delegated administrator account for CloudTrail on the CloudTrail [Settings](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrailv2/home#/settings) page\. This must be done before the delegated administrator account can create an event data store for use by the entire organization\.

**To turn on CloudTrail Lake event tracking from Change Manager**

1. Open the AWS Systems Manager console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/systems\-manager/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Change Manager**\.

   \-or\-

   If the AWS Systems Manager home page opens first, choose the menu icon \(![\[The menu icon\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/images/menu-icon-small.png)\) to open the navigation pane, and then choose **Change Manager**\.

1. Choose the **Requests** tab\.

1. Choose any existing change request, and then choose the **Associated events** tab\.

1. Choose **Enable CloudTrail Lake**\.

1. Follow the steps in [Create an event data store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/query-event-data-store.html) in the *AWS CloudTrail User Guide*, beginning with step 3\.

   To ensure that event data for your change requests is stored, make the following selections:
   + After step 8, for **Event type**, leave the defaults **AWS events** and **CloudTrail events** selected\.
   + On step 12, if you're using Change Manager with an organization, select **Enable for all accounts in my organization**\.
   + On step 13, for **Management events**, do not clear the **Write** check box\. 

   Complete the **Create event data store** wizard\. Other options you choose when creating your event data store don't affect the storage of event data for your change requests\.
