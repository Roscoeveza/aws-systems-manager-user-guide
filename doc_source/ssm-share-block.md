# Block public sharing for SSM documents<a name="ssm-share-block"></a>

Unless your use case requires public sharing to be turned on, we recommend turning on the block public sharing setting for your AWS Systems Manager \(SSM\) documents\. Turning on this setting prevents unwanted access to your SSM documents\. The block public sharing setting is an account level setting that can differ for each AWS Region\. Complete the following tasks to block public sharing for your SSM documents\.

## Block public sharing \(console\)<a name="share-block-console"></a>

1. Open the AWS Systems Manager console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/systems\-manager/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Documents**\.

   \-or\-

   If the AWS Systems Manager home page opens first, choose the menu icon \(![\[The menu icon\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/images/menu-icon-small.png)\) to open the navigation pane, and then choose **Documents** in the navigation pane\.

## Restricting access to block public sharing with IAM<a name="share-block-iam"></a>

You can create AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) policies that restrict users from modifying the block public sharing setting\. This prevents users from allowing unwanted access to your SSM documents\. 

The following is an example of an IAM policy that prevents users from updating the block public sharing setting\. To use this example, you must replace the example Amazon Web Services account ID with your own account ID\.

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Action": "ssm:UpdateServiceSetting",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:ssm:*:987654321098:servicesetting/ssm/documents/console/public-sharing-permission"
        }
    ]
}
```
