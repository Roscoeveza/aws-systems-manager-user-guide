# Example 1: Creating parent\-child runbooks<a name="automation-authoring-runbooks-parent-child-example"></a>

The following example demonstrates how to create two runbooks that patch tagged groups of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\) instances in stages\. These runbooks are used in a parent\-child relationship with the parent runbook used to initiate a rate control automation of the child runbook\. For more information about rate control automations, see [Run automations at scale](running-automations-scale.md)\. For more information about the automation actions used in this example, see the [Systems ManagerÂ Automation actions reference](automation-actions.md)\.

## Create the child runbook<a name="automation-authoring-runbooks-child-runbook"></a>

This example runbook addresses the following scenario\. Emily is a Systems Engineer at AnyCompany Consultants, LLC\. She needs to configure patching for groups of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\) instances that host primary and secondary databases\. Applications access these databases 24 hours a day, so one of the database instances must always be available\. 

She decides that patching the instances in stages is the best approach\. The primary group of database instances will be patched first, followed by the secondary group of database instances\. Also, to avoid incurring additional costs by leaving instances running that were previously stopped, Emily wants the patched instances to be returned to their original state before the patching occurred\. 

Emily identifies the primary and secondary groups of database instances by the tags associated with the instances\. She decides to create a parent runbook that starts a rate control automation of a child runbook\. By doing that, she can target the tags associated with the primary and secondary groups of database instances and manage the concurrency of the child automations\. After reviewing the available Systems Manager \(SSM\) documents for patching, she chooses the `AWS-RunPatchBaseline` document\. By using this SSM document, her colleagues can review the associated patch compliance information after the patching operation completes\.

To start creating her runbook content, Emily reviews the available automation actions and begins authoring the content for the child runbook as follows:

1. First, she provides values for the schema and description of the runbook, and defines the input parameters for the child runbook\.

   By using the `AutomationAssumeRole` parameter, Emily and her colleagues can use an existing IAM role that allows Automation to perform the actions in the runbook on their behalf\. Emily uses the `InstanceId` parameter to determine the instance that should be patched\. Optionally, the `Operation`, `RebootOption`, and `SnapshotId` parameters can be used to provide values to document parameters for `AWS-RunPatchBaseline`\. To prevent invalid values from being provided to those document parameters, she defines the `allowedValues` as needed\.

1. With the top\-level elements defined, Emily proceeds with authoring the actions that make up the `mainSteps` of the runbook\. The first step outputs the current state of the target instance specified in the `InstanceId` input parameter using the `aws:executeAwsApi` action\. The output of this action is used in later actions\.

            ],

         },
   ```

------

1. Rather than manually starting and keeping track of the original state of every instance that needs to be patched, Emily uses the output from the previous action to branch the automation based on the state of the target instance\. This allows the automation to run different steps depending on the conditions defined in the `aws:branch` action and improves the overall efficiency of the automation without manual intervention\.

   If the instance state is already `running`, the automation proceeds with patching the instance with the `AWS-RunPatchBaseline` document using the `aws:runCommand` action\.

   If the instance state is `stopping`, the automation polls for the instance to reach the `stopped` state using the `aws:waitForAwsResourceProperty` action, starts the instance using the `executeAwsApi` action, and polls for the instance to reach a `running` state before patching the instance\.

   If the instance state is `stopped`, the automation starts the instance and polls for the instance to reach a `running` state before patching the instance using the same actions\.

1. After the patching operation completes, Emily wants the automation to return the target instance to the same state it was in before the automation started\. She does this by again using the output from the first action\. The automation branches based on the original state of the target instance using the `aws:branch` action\. If the instance was previously in any state other than `running`, the instance is stopped\. Otherwise, if the instance state is `running`, the automation ends\.

## Create the parent runbook<a name="automation-authoring-runbooks-parent-runbook"></a>

This example runbook continues the scenario described in the previous section\. Now that Emily has created the child runbook, she begins authoring the content for the parent runbook as follows:

1. First, she provides values for the schema and description of the runbook, and defines the input parameters for the parent runbook\.

   By using the `AutomationAssumeRole` parameter, Emily and her colleagues can use an existing IAM role that allows Automation to perform the actions in the runbook on their behalf\. Emily uses the `PatchGroupPrimaryKey` and `PatchGroupPrimaryValue` parameters to specify the tag associated with the primary group of database instances that will be patched\. She uses the `PatchGroupSecondaryKey` and `PatchGroupSecondaryValue` parameters to specify the tag associated with the secondary group of database instances that will be patched\.

1. With the top\-level elements defined, Emily proceeds with authoring the actions that make up the `mainSteps` of the runbook\. 

   The first action starts a rate control automation using the child runbook she just created that targets instances associated with the tag specified in the `PatchGroupPrimaryKey` and `PatchGroupPrimaryValue` input parameters\. She uses the values provided to the input parameters to specify the key and value of the tag associated with the primary group of database instances she wants to patch\.

   After the first automation completes, the second action starts another rate control automation using the child runbook that targets instances associated with the tag specified in the `PatchGroupSecondaryKey` and `PatchGroupSecondaryValue` input parameters\. She uses the values provided to the input parameters to specify the key and value of the tag associated with the secondary group of database instances she wants to patch\.

Now, she is ready to test her runbooks to make sure the automation operates as desired before implementing them into her production environment\.
