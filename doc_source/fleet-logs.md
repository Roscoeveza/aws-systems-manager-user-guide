You can use Fleet Manager, a capability of AWS Systems Manager, to view log data stored on your managed nodes\. For Windows managed nodes, you can view Windows event logs and copy their details from the console\. To help you search events, filter Windows event logs by **Event level**, **Event ID**, **Event source**, and **Time created**\. You can also view other log data using the procedure to view the file system\.
