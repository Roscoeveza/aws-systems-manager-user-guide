# Configuring inventory collection<a name="sysman-inventory-configuring"></a>

This section describes how to configure AWS Systems Manager Inventory collection on one or more managed nodes by using the Systems Manager console\. For an example of how to configure inventory collection by using the AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\), see [Systems Manager Inventory walkthroughs](sysman-inventory-walk.md)\.

When you configure inventory collection, you start by creating a AWS Systems Manager State Manager association\. Systems Manager collects the inventory data when the association is run\. If you don't create the association first, and attempt to invoke the `aws:softwareInventory` plugin by using, for example, AWS Systems Manager Run Command, the system returns the following error: `The aws:softwareInventory plugin can only be invoked via ssm-associate.`

**Note**  
Be aware of the following behavior if you create multiple inventory associations for a managed node:  
Each node can be assigned an inventory association that targets *all* nodes \(\-\-targets "Key=InstanceIds,Values=\*"\)\.
Each node can also be assigned a specific association that uses either tag key/value pairs or an AWS resource group\.
If a node is assigned multiple inventory associations, the status shows *Skipped* for the association that hasn't run\. The association that ran most recently displays the actual status of the inventory association\.
If a node is assigned multiple inventory associations and each uses a tag key/value pair, then those inventory associations fail to run on the node because of the tag conflict\. The association still runs on nodes that don't have the tag key/value conflict\. 

**Before You Begin**  
Before you configure inventory collection, complete the following tasks\.
+ Update AWS Systems Manager SSM Agent on the nodes you want to inventory\. By running the latest version of SSM Agent, you ensure that you can collect metadata for all supported inventory types\. For information about how to update SSM Agent by using State Manager, see [Walkthrough: Automatically update SSM Agent \(CLI\)](sysman-state-cli.md)\.
+ Verify that your nodes meet Systems Manager prerequisites\. For more information, see [Systems Manager prerequisites](systems-manager-prereqs.md)\.
+ For Microsoft Windows nodes, verify that your managed node is configured with Windows PowerShell 3\.0 \(or later\)\. SSM Agent uses the `ConvertTo-Json` cmdlet in PowerShell to convert Windows update inventory data to the required format\.
+ \(Optional\) Create a resource data sync to centrally store inventory data in an Amazon S3 bucket\. resource data sync then automatically updates the centralized data when new inventory data is collected\. For more information, see [Configuring resource data sync for Inventory](sysman-inventory-datasync.md)\.
+ \(Optional\) Create a JSON file to collect custom inventory\. For more information, see [Working with custom inventory](sysman-inventory-custom.md)\.

## Inventory all managed nodes in your AWS account<a name="inventory-management-inventory-all"></a>

You can inventory all managed nodes in your AWS account by creating a global inventory association\. A global inventory association performs the following actions:
+ Automatically applies the global inventory configuration \(association\) to all existing managed nodes in your AWS account\. Managed nodes that already have an inventory association are skipped when the global inventory association is applied and runs\. When a node is skipped, the detailed status message states `Overridden By Explicit Inventory Association`\. Those nodes are skipped by the global association, but they will still report inventory when they run their assigned inventory association\.
+ Automatically adds new nodes created in your AWS account to the global inventory association\.

**Note**  
If a managed node is configured for the global inventory association, and you assign a specific association to that node, then Systems Manager Inventory deprioritizes the global association and applies the specific association\.
Global inventory associations are available in SSM Agent version 2\.0\.790\.0 or later\. For information about how to update SSM Agent on your nodes, see [Updating the SSM Agent using Run Command](run-command-tutorial-update-software.md#rc-console-agentexample)\.

### Configuring inventory collection with one click \(console\)<a name="sysman-inventory-config-collection-one-click"></a>

Use the following procedure to configure Systems Manager Inventory for all managed nodes in your AWS account and in a single AWS Region\. 

**To configure all of your managed nodes in the current Region for Systems Manager inventory**

1. Open the AWS Systems Manager console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/systems\-manager/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Inventory**\.

   \-or\-

   If the AWS Systems Manager home page opens first, choose the menu icon \(![\[The menu icon\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/images/menu-icon-small.png)\) to open the navigation pane, and then choose **Inventory** in the navigation pane\.

1. In the **Managed instances with inventory enabled** card, choose **Click here to enable inventory on all instances**\.  
![\[Turning on Systems Manager Inventory on all managed nodes in the current AWS account and AWS Region.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/images/inventory-one-click-1.png)

   If successful, the console displays the following message\.  
![\[Turning on Systems Manager Inventory on all managed nodes in the current AWS account and AWS Region.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/images/inventory-one-click-2.png)

   Depending on the number of managed nodes in your account, it can take several minutes for the global inventory association to be applied\. Wait a few minutes and then refresh the page\. Verify that the graphic changes to reflect that inventory is configured on all of your managed nodes\.

### Configuring collection by using the console<a name="sysman-inventory-config-collection"></a>

This section includes information about how to configure Systems Manager Inventory to collect metadata from your managed nodes by using the Systems Manager console\. You can quickly collect metadata from all nodes in a specific AWS account \(and any future nodes that might be created in that account\) or you can selectively collect inventory data by using tags or node IDs\.

**To configure inventory collection**

1. Open the AWS Systems Manager console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/systems\-manager/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Inventory**\.

   \-or\-

   If the AWS Systems Manager home page opens first, choose the menu icon \(![\[The menu icon\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/images/menu-icon-small.png)\) to open the navigation pane, and then choose **Inventory** in the navigation pane\.

1. Choose **Setup Inventory**\.

1. In the **Targets** section, identify the nodes where you want to run this operation by choosing one of the following\.
   + **Selecting all managed instances in this account** \- This option selects all managed nodes for which there is no existing inventory association\. If you choose this option, nodes that already had inventory associations are skipped during inventory collection, and shown with a status of **Skipped** in inventory results\. For more information, see [Inventory all managed nodes in your AWS account](#inventory-management-inventory-all)\. 
   + **Specifying a tag** \- Use this option to specify a single tag to identify nodes in your account from which you want to collect inventory\. If you use a tag, any nodes created in the future with the same tag will also report inventory\. If there is an existing inventory association with all nodes, using a tag to select specific nodes as a target for a different inventory overrides node membership in the **All managed instances** target group\. Managed nodes with the specified tag are skipped on future inventory collection from **All managed instances**\.
   + **Manually selecting instances** \- Use this option to choose specific managed nodes in your account\. Explicitly choosing specific nodes by using this option overrides inventory associations on the **All managed instances** target\. The node is skipped on future inventory collection from **All managed instances**\.
**Note**  
If a managed node you expect to see isn't listed, see [Troubleshooting managed node availability](troubleshooting-managed-instances.md) for troubleshooting tips\.

1. In the **Schedule** section, choose how often you want the system to collect inventory metadata from your nodes\.

1. In the **Parameters** section, use the lists to turn on or turn off different types of inventory collection\. See the following samples if you want to create an inventory search for **Files** or the **Windows Registry**\.

**Files**
   + On Linux and macOS, collect metadata of \.sh files in the `/home/ec2-user` directory, excluding all subdirectories\.

     ```
     [{"Path":"/home/ec2-user","Pattern":["*.sh", "*.sh"],"Recursive":false}]
     ```
   + On Windows, collect metadata of all "\.exe" files in the Program Files folder, including subdirectories recursively\.

     ```
     [{"Path":"C:\Program Files","Pattern":["*.exe"],"Recursive":true}]
     ```
   + On Windows, collect metadata of specific log patterns\.

     ```
     [{"Path":"C:\ProgramData\Amazon","Pattern":["*amazon*.log"],"Recursive":true}]
     ```
   + Limit the directory count when performing recursive collection\.

     ```
     [{"Path":"C:\Users","Pattern":["*.ps1"],"Recursive":true, "DirScanLimit": 1000}]
     ```

**Windows registry**
   + Collect all keys and values recursively for a specific path\.

     ```
     [{"Path":"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Amazon","Recursive": true}]
     ```
   + Collect all keys and values for a specific path \(recursive search turned off\)\.

     ```
     [{"Path":"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Intel\PSIS\PSIS_DECODER", "Recursive": false}]
     ```
   + Collect a specific key by using the `ValueNames` option\.

     ```
     {"Path":"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Amazon\MachineImage","ValueNames":["AMIName"]}
     ```

   For more information about collecting File and Windows Registry inventory, see [Working with file and Windows registry inventory](sysman-inventory-file-and-registry.md)\.

1. In the **Advanced** section, choose **Sync inventory execution logs to an Amazon S3 bucket** if you want to store the association execution status in an Amazon S3 bucket\.

1. Choose **Setup Inventory**\. Systems Manager creates a State Manager association and immediately runs Inventory on the nodes\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **State Manager**\. Verify that a new association was created that uses the `AWS-GatherSoftwareInventory` document\. The association schedule uses a rate expression\. Also, verify that the **Status** field shows **Success**\. If you chose the option to **Sync inventory execution logs to an Amazon S3 bucket**, then you can view the log data in Amazon S3 after a few minutes\. If you want to view inventory data for a specific node, then choose **Managed Instances** in the navigation pane\. 

1. Choose a node, and then choose **View details**\.

1. On the node details page, choose **Inventory**\. Use the **Inventory type** lists to filter the inventory\.
