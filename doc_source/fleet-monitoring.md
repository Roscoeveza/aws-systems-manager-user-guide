# Monitoring managed node performance<a name="fleet-monitoring"></a>

You can use Fleet Manager, a capability of AWS Systems Manager, to view performance data about your managed nodes in real time\. The performance data is retrieved from performance counters\.

The following performance counters are available in Fleet Manager:
+ CPU utilization
+ Disk input/output \(I/O\) utilization
+ Network traffic
+ Memory usage

**Note**  
Fleet Manager uses Session Manager, a capability of AWS Systems Manager, to retrieve performance data\. For Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\) instances, the instance profile attached to your managed instances must provide permissions for Session Manager to use this feature\. For more information about adding Session Manager permissions to an instance profile, see [Adding Session Manager permissions to an existing IAM role](getting-started-add-permissions-to-existing-profile.md)\. Also, AWS Key Management Service \(AWS KMS\) encryption must be turned on in your session preferences to use Fleet Manager features\. For more information about turning on AWS KMS encryption for Session Manager, see [Turn on KMS key encryption of session data \(console\)](session-preferences-enable-encryption.md)\.
