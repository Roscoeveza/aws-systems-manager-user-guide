# Manually installing SSM Agent on Oracle Linux instances<a name="agent-install-oracle"></a>

The Amazon Machine Images \(AMIs\) for Oracle Linux that are provided by AWS do not come with AWS Systems Manager Agent \(SSM Agent\) preinstalled by default\. For a list of AWS managed AMIs on which the agent might be preinstalled, see [Amazon Machine Images \(AMIs\) with SSM Agent preinstalled](ami-preinstalled-agent.md)\.

Use the information in this section to help you manually install or reinstall SSM Agent on an Oracle Linux instance\.

**Before you begin**  
Before you install SSM Agent on an Oracle Linux instance, note the following:
+ For important information that applies to installation of SSM Agent on all Linux\-based operating systems, see [Manually installing SSM Agent on EC2 instances for Linux](sysman-manual-agent-install.md)\.
+ If you use a `yum` command to update SSM Agent on a managed node after the agent has been installed or updated using the SSM document `AWS-UpdateSSMAgent`, you might see the following message: "Warning: RPMDB altered outside of yum\." This message is expected and can be safely ignored\.

## Quick installation commands for SSM Agent on Oracle Linux<a name="quick-install-oracle"></a>

Use the following steps to manually install SSM Agent on a single instance\. This procedure uses globally available installation files\. 

**To install SSM Agent on Oracle Linux using quick copy and paste commands**

1. Connect to your Oracle Linux instance using your preferred method, such as SSH\.

1. Copy the following command and run it on the instance\.
**Note**  
Even though URL in the following command includes an `ec2-downloads-windows` directory, these are the correct global installation files for Oracle Linux\.   
**x86\_64**  

   ```
   sudo yum install -y https://s3.amazonaws.com/ec2-downloads-windows/SSMAgent/latest/linux_amd64/amazon-ssm-agent.rpm
   ```

1. \(Recommended\) Run the following command to verify that the agent is running\.

   ```
   sudo systemctl status amazon-ssm-agent
   ```

   In most cases, the command reports that the agent is running, as shown in the following example\.

   ```
   amazon-ssm-agent.service - amazon-ssm-agent
   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/amazon-ssm-agent.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
   Active: active (running) since Wed 2021-10-20 19:09:29 UTC; 4min 6s ago
               --truncated--
   ```

   In rare cases, the command reports that the agent is installed but not running, as shown in the following example\.

   ```
   amazon-ssm-agent.service - amazon-ssm-agent
   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/amazon-ssm-agent.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
   Active: inactive (dead) since Wed 2021-10-20 22:16:41 UTC; 18s ago
               --truncated--
   ```

   To activate the agent in these cases, run the following commands\.

   ```
   sudo systemctl enable amazon-ssm-agent
   ```

   ```
   sudo systemctl start amazon-ssm-agent
   ```

## Create custom agent installation commands for Oracle Linux in your Region<a name="custom-url-oracle"></a>

When you install SSM Agent on multiple instances using a script or template, we recommended using installation files that are stored in the AWS Region you're working in\. 

For the following commands, we provide examples that use a publicly accessible S3 bucket in the US East \(Ohio\) Region \(`us-east-2`\)\. 

**Tip**  
You can also replace a global URL in the procedure [Quick installation commands for SSM Agent on Oracle Linux](#quick-install-oracle) earlier in this topic with a custom Regional URL you construct\.

In the following command, replace *region* with your own information\. For a list of supported *region* values, see the **Region** column in [Systems Manager service endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/ssm.html#ssm_region) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*\.

**x86\_64**  

```
sudo yum install -y https://s3.region.amazonaws.com/amazon-ssm-region/latest/linux_amd64/amazon-ssm-agent.rpm
```
See the following example\.  

```
sudo yum install -y https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/amazon-ssm-us-east-2/latest/linux_amd64/amazon-ssm-agent.rpm
```
