# Working with the file system<a name="fleet-file-management"></a>

You can use Fleet Manager, a capability of AWS Systems Manager, to work with the file system on your managed nodes\. Using Fleet Manager, you can view information about the directory and file data stored on the volumes attached to your managed nodes\. For example, you can view the name, size, extension, owner, and permissions for your directories and files\. Up to 10,000 lines of file data can be previewed as text from the Fleet Manager console\. You can also use this feature to `tail` files\. When using `tail` to view file data, the last 10 lines of the file are displayed initially\. As new lines of data are written to the file, the view is updated in real time\. As a result, you can review log data from the console, which can improve the efficiency of your troubleshooting and systems administration\. Additionally, you can create directories and copy, cut, paste, rename, or delete files and directories\.

We recommend creating regular backups, or taking snapshots of the Amazon Elastic Block Store \(Amazon EBS\) volumes attached to your managed nodes\. When copying, or cutting and pasting files, existing files and directories in the destination path with the same name as the new files or directories are replaced\. Serious problems can occur if you replace or modify system files and directories\. AWS doesn't guarantee that these problems can be solved\. Modify system files at your own risk\. You're responsible for all file and directory changes, and ensuring you have backups\. Deleting or replacing files and directories can't be undone\.

**Note**  
Fleet Manager uses Session Manager, a capability of AWS Systems Manager, to view text previews and `tail` files\. For Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\) instances, the instance profile attached to your managed instances must provide permissions for Session Manager to use this feature\. For more information about adding Session Manager permissions to an instance profile, see [Adding Session Manager permissions to an existing IAM role](getting-started-add-permissions-to-existing-profile.md)\. Also, AWS Key Management Service \(AWS KMS\) encryption must be turned on in your session preferences to use Fleet Manager features\. For more information about enabling AWS KMS encryption for Session Manager, see [Turn on KMS key encryption of session data \(console\)](session-preferences-enable-encryption.md)\.
