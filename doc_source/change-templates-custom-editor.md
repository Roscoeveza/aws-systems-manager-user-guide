# Creating change templates using Editor<a name="change-templates-custom-editor"></a>

Use the steps in this topic to configure a change template in Change Manager, a capability of AWS Systems Manager, by entering JSON or YAML instead of using the console controls\.

**To create a change template using Editor**

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Change Manager**\.

   \-or\-

   If the AWS Systems Manager home page opens first, choose the menu icon \(![\[The menu icon\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/images/menu-icon-small.png)\) to open the navigation pane, and then choose **Change Manager**\.

1. Choose **Create template**\.

1. For **Name**, enter a name for the template that makes its purpose easy to identify, such as **RestartEC2LinuxInstance**\.

1. Above **Change template details**, choose **Editor**\.

1. In the **Document editor** section, choose **Edit**, and then enter the JSON or YAML content for your change template\. 

   The following is an example\.
**Note**  
The parameter `minRequiredApprovals` is used to specify how many reviewers at a specified level must approve a change request that is created using this template\.  
This example demonstrates two levels of approvals\. You can specify up to five levels of approvals, but only one level is required\.   
In the first level, the specific user "John\-Doe" must approve each change request\. After that, any three members of the IAM role `Admin` must approve the change request\.  
For more information about approvals for change templates, see [About approvals in your change templates](cm-approvals-templates.md)\.
