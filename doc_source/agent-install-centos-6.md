## Quick installation commands for SSM Agent on CentOS 6<a name="quick-install-centos-6"></a>

Use the following steps to manually install SSM Agent on a single instance\. This procedure uses globally available installation files\. 

**To install SSM Agent on CentOS 6\.x**

1. Connect to your CentOS 6 instance using your preferred method, such as SSH\. 

1. Copy the command for your instanceâ€™s architecture and run it on the instance\.
**Note**  
Even though URLs in the following commands include an `ec2-downloads-windows` directory, these are the correct global installation files for CentOS 6\.   
The following commands specify the version directory `3.0.1479.0` instead of a `latest` directory\. This is because SSM Agent version 3\.1 and later are not supported for CentOS 6\.  
x86\_64 instances  

   ```
   sudo yum install -y https://s3.amazonaws.com/ec2-downloads-windows/SSMAgent/3.0.1479.0/linux_amd64/amazon-ssm-agent.rpm
   ```  
x86 instances  

   ```
   sudo yum install -y https://s3.amazonaws.com/ec2-downloads-windows/SSMAgent/3.0.1479.0/linux_386/amazon-ssm-agent.rpm
   ```

1. \(Recommended\) Run the following command to verify that the agent is running\.

   ```
   sudo status amazon-ssm-agent
   ```

   In most cases, the command reports that the agent is running, as shown in the following example\.

   ```
   amazon-ssm-agent start/running, process 1744
   ```

   In rare cases, the command reports that the agent is installed but not running, as shown in the following example\.

   ```
   amazon-ssm-agent stop/waiting
   ```

   To activate the agent in these cases, run the following command\.

   ```
   sudo start amazon-ssm-agent
   ```

## Create custom agent installation commands for CentOS 6 in your Region<a name="custom-url-centos-6"></a>

When you install SSM Agent on multiple instances using a script or template, we recommended using installation files that are stored in the AWS Region you're working in\. 

For the following commands, we provide examples that use a publicly accessible S3 bucket in the US East \(Ohio\) Region \(`us-east-2`\)\. 

**Tip**  
You can also replace a global URL in the procedure [Quick installation commands for SSM Agent on CentOS 6](#quick-install-centos-6) earlier in this topic with a custom Regional URL you construct\.

In the following command, replace *region* with your own information\. For a list of supported *region* values, see the **Region** column in [Systems Manager service endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/ssm.html#ssm_region) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*\.

**Note**  
The following commands specify the version directory `3.0.1390.0` instead of a `latest` directory\. This is because SSM Agent version 3\.1 and later are not supported for CentOS 6\.

x86\_64  

```
sudo yum install -y https://s3.region.amazonaws.com/amazon-ssm-region/3.0.1479.0/linux_amd64/amazon-ssm-agent.rpm
```
See the following example\.  

```
sudo yum install -y https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/amazon-ssm-us-east-2/3.0.1479.0/linux_amd64/amazon-ssm-agent.rpm
```

x86  

```
sudo yum install -y https://s3.region.amazonaws.com/amazon-ssm-region/3.0.1479.0/linux_386/amazon-ssm-agent.rpm
```
See the following example\.  

```
sudo yum install -y https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/amazon-ssm-us-east-2/3.0.1479.0/linux_386/amazon-ssm-agent.rpm
