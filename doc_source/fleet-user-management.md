# User management<a name="fleet-user-management"></a>

You can use Fleet Manager, a capability of AWS Systems Manager, to manage operating system \(OS\) user accounts on your managed nodes\. For example, you can create and delete users and groups\. Additionally, you can view details like group membership, user roles, and status\.

**Important**  
Fleet Manager uses Run Command and Session Manager, capabilities of AWS Systems Manager, for various user management operations\. As a result, a user could grant permissions to an operating system user account that they would otherwise be unable to\. This is because AWS Systems Manager Agent \(SSM Agent\) runs on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\) instances using root permissions \(Linux\) or SYSTEM permissions \(Windows Server\)\. For more information about restricting access to root\-level commands through the SSM Agent, see [Restricting access to root\-level commands through SSM Agent](ssm-agent-restrict-root-level-commands.md)\. To restrict access to this feature, we recommend creating AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) policies for your users that only allow access to the actions you define\. For more information about creating IAM policies for Fleet Manager, see [Step 1: Create an IAM policy with Fleet Manager permissions](fleet-setup-iam.md)\.

**Note**  
Fleet Manager uses Session Manager to set passwords for new users\. For Amazon EC2 instances, the instance profile attached to your managed instances must provide permissions for Session Manager to use this feature\. For more information about adding Session Manager permissions to an instance profile, see [Adding Session Manager permissions to an existing IAM role](getting-started-add-permissions-to-existing-profile.md)\. Also, AWS Key Management Service \(AWS KMS\) encryption must be turned on in your session preferences to use Fleet Manager features\. For more information about enabling AWS KMS encryption for Session Manager, see [Turn on KMS key encryption of session data \(console\)](session-preferences-enable-encryption.md)\.
