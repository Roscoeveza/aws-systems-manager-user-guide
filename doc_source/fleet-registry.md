# Windows registry management<a name="fleet-registry"></a>

You can use Fleet Manager, a capability of AWS Systems Manager, to manage the registry on your Windows managed nodes\. From the Fleet Manager console you can create, copy, update, and delete registry entries and values\.

**Important**  
We recommend creating a backup of the registry, or taking a snapshot of the root Amazon Elastic Block Store \(Amazon EBS\) volume attached to your managed node, before you modify the registry\. Serious problems can occur if you modify the registry incorrectly\. These problems might require you to reinstall the operating system, or restore the root volume of your node from a snapshot\. AWS doesn't guarantee that these problems can be solved\. Modify the registry at your own risk\. You're responsible for all registry changes, and ensuring you have backups\.
