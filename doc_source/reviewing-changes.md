# Reviewing change request details, tasks, and timelines \(console\)<a name="reviewing-changes"></a>

You can view information about a change request, including requests for which changes have already been processed, in the dashboard of Change Manager, a capability of AWS Systems Manager\. These details include a link to the Automation operation that runs the runbooks that make the change\. An Automation execution ID is generated when the request is created, but the process doesn't run until all approvals have been given and no restrictions are in place to block the change\.
