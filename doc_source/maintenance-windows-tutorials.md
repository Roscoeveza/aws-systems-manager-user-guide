# Systems Manager Maintenance Windows tutorials \(AWS CLI\)<a name="maintenance-windows-tutorials"></a>

This section includes tutorials that help you learn how to use the AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\) to do the following:
+ Create and configure a maintenance window
+ View information about a maintenance window
+ View information about maintenance windows tasks and task executions
+ Update a maintenance window
+ Delete a maintenance window

**Complete prerequisites**  
Before trying these tutorials, complete the following prerequisites\.
+ **Configure the AWS CLI on your local machine** – Before you can run AWS CLI commands, you must install and configure the CLI on your local machine\. For information, see [Installing or updating the latest version of the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) and [Installing the AWS Tools for PowerShell](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/userguide/pstools-getting-set-up.html)\.
+ **Verify maintenance window roles and permissions** – An AWS administrator in your account must grant you the AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) permissions you need to manage maintenance windows using the CLI\. For information, see [Setting up Maintenance Windows](sysman-maintenance-permissions.md)\.
+ **Create or configure an instance that is compatible with Systems Manager ** – You need at least one Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\) instance that is configured for use with Systems Manager to complete the tutorials\. This means that SSM Agent is installed on the instance, and an IAM instance profile for Systems Manager is attached to the instance\. 

  We recommend launching an instance from one AWS managed Amazon Machine Image \(AMI\) with the agent preinstalled\. For more information, see [Amazon Machine Images \(AMIs\) with SSM Agent preinstalled](ami-preinstalled-agent.md)\.

  For information about installing SSM Agent on an instance, see the following topics:
  + [Working with SSM Agent on EC2 instances for Windows Server](sysman-install-ssm-win.md)
  + [Working with SSM Agent on EC2 instances for Linux](sysman-install-ssm-agent.md)

  For information about configuring IAM permissions for Systems Manager to your instance, see [Configure instance permissions for Systems Manager](setup-instance-permissions.md)\.
+ **Create additional resources as needed** – Run Command, a capability of Systems Manager, includes many tasks that don't require you to create resources other than those listed in this prerequisites topic\. For that reason, we provide a simple Run Command task for you to use your first time through the tutorials\. You also need an EC2 instance that is configured to use with Systems Manager, as described earlier in this topic\. After you configure that instance, you can register a simple Run Command task\. 

  The Systems Manager Maintenance Windows capability supports running the following four types of tasks: 
  + Run Command commands
  + Systems Manager Automation workflows
  + AWS Lambda functions
  + AWS Step Functions tasks

  In general, if a maintenance window task that you want to run requires additional resources, you should create them first\. For example, if you want a maintenance window that runs an AWS Lambda function, create the Lambda function before you begin; for a Run Command task, create the S3 bucket that you can save command output to \(if you plan to do so\); and so on\.

**Keep track of resource IDs**  
As you complete the tasks in this AWS CLI tutorial, keep track of resource IDs generated by the commands you run\. You use many of these as input for subsequent commands\. For example, when you create the maintenance window, the system provides you with a maintenance window ID in the following format\.

```
{
   "WindowId":"mw-0c50858d01EXAMPLE"
}
```

Make a note of the following system\-generated IDs because the tutorials in this section use them:
+ `WindowId`
+ `WindowTargetId`
+ `WindowTaskId`
+ `WindowExecutionId`
+ `TaskExecutionId`
+ `InvocationId`
+ `ExecutionId`

You also need the ID of the EC2 instance that you plan to use in the tutorial\. For example: `i-02573cafcfEXAMPLE`
